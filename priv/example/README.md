# Example project with Svx single-file components

This project was generated with

```
mix phx.new example --live --no-ecto --no-gettext --no-dashboard --no-mailer
```

So you can start it without needing a database

# Single-file components

There's a single single-file component at `lib/example_web/live/thermostat.lsvx`.
It is basically same component you create in the [LiveView introduction](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html)
